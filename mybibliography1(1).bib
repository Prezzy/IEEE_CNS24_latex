The first rigorous treatment was provided by Halevi and Krawczyk, who studied off-line password guessing attacks in the scenario in which the authentication server possesses a pair of private and public keys. In this work we:
Show the inadequacy of both the HK formalization and protocol in the case where there is more than a single user: using a simple and realistic attack, we prove failure of the HK solution in the two-user case.Propose a new definition of security for the multi-user case, expressed in terms of transcripts of the entire system, rather than individual protocol executions.Suggest several ways of achieving this security against both static and dynamic adversaries.In a recent revision of their paper, Halevi and Krawczyk again attempted to handle the multi-user case. We expose a weakness in their revised definition.},

abstract = {We study protocols for strong authentication and key exchange in asymmetric scenarios where the authentication server possesses ~a pair of private and public keys while the client has only a weak human-memorizable password as its authentication key. We present and analyze several simple password authentication protocols in this scenario, and show that the security of these protocols can be formally proven based on standard cryptographic assumptions. Remarkably, our analysis shows optimal resistance to off-line password guessing attacks under the choice of suitable public key encryption functions. In addition to user authentication, we describe ways to enhance these protocols to provide two-way authentication, authenticated key exchange, defense against server's compromise, and user  anonymity. We complement these results with a proof that strongly indicates that public key techniques are unavoidable for password protocols that resist off-line guessing attacks.As a further contribution, we introduce the notion of public passwords that enables the use of the above protocols in situations where the client's machine does not have the means to validate the server's public key. Public passwords serve as "hand-held certificates" that the user can carry without the need for specal computing devices.},

abstract="We present strong evidence that the implication, ``if one-way permutations exist, then secure secret key agreement is possible'', is not provable by standard techniques. Since both sides of this implication are widely believed true in real life, to show that the implication is false requires a new model. We consider a world where all parties have access to a black box for a randomly selected permutation. Being totally random, this permutation will be strongly one-way in a provable, information-theoretic way. We show that, if P = NP, no protocol for secret key agreement is secure in such a setting. Thus, to prove that a secret key agreement protocol which uses a one-way permutation as a black box is secure is as hard as proving P ≠ NP. We also obtain, as a corollary, that there is an oracle relative to which the implication is false, i.e., there is a one-way permutation, yet secret-exchange is impossible. Thus, no technique which relativizes can prove that secret exchange can be based on any one-way permutation. Our results present a general framework for proving statements of the form, ``Cryptographic application X is not likely possible based solely on complexity assumption Y.''",

abstract="In this paper we formalize the notion of a ring signature, which makes it possible to specify a set of possible signers without revealing which member actually produced the signature.Unlike group signatures, ring signatures have no group managers, no setup procedures, no revocation procedures, and no coordination:any user can choose any set of possible signers that includes himself,and sign any message by using his secret key and the others' public keys,without getting their approval or assistance. Ring signatures provide an elegant way to leak authoritativ secrets in an anonymous way, to sign casual email in a way which can only be verified by its intended recipient, and to solve other problems in multiparty computations. The main contribution of this paper is a new construction of such signatures which is unconditionally signer-ambiguous, provably secure in the random oracle model,and exceptionally efficient:adding each ring member increases the cost of signing or verifying by a single modular multiplication and a single symmetric encryption.",

abstract = {The majority of today's authentication systems, including password and fingerprint scanners, are based on one-time, static authentication methods. A continuous, real-time authentication system opens up the possibility for greater security, but such a system must be unobtrusive and secure. In this work we studied whether a commercial eye tracker can be used for unobtrusive, continuous, real-time user authentication via iris recognition. In a user study, all 37 participants could be authenticated with 11\% equal error rate (EER). For 14 of the 37 users, iris occlusion was sufficiently small to authenticate with 9\% EER. When classified using a k-nearest neighbors algorithm and only the right iris, the same data set allowed 100\% accuracy for k = 3. Although these error rates are too high for standalone use, iris recognition via an eye tracker might enable real-time continuous authentication when combined with other more reliable authentication means (e.g., a password). As eye trackers become widely available their capabilities for multiple factor, continuous authentication will become compelling.},

abstract = {Digitization, in terms of online services, work environment and other day-to-day procedures, has lead to the wide adoption and use of the respective digital identities. Users utilize their digital personas and their corresponding attributes on a daily basis, in order to gain access to resources and services. This is achieved through the use of numerous identity management schemes, which often suffer from multiple vulnerabilities and are susceptible to threats. This results in the compromise of user privacy and data security. In the recent years, new technologies related to identity management, like the Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) and eIDAS concepts, are employed to mitigate these issues. This paper presents an architecture that combines state-of-the-art technologies regarding identity management, authentication and secure storage. More specifically, the proposed framework utilizes IOTA-based SSI, the eIDAS framework, FIDO protocol and Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), resulting in a trusted and secure identity management framework. Our solution is thoroughly presented via scenarios, showcasing its robustness and how well it copes in relation to our threat model.},

abstract = {WebAuthn as part of FIDO2 is a new standard for two-factor and even password-less user authentication to web-services. Leading browsers, like Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Mozilla Firefox, support the WebAuthn API. Unfortunately, the availability of hardware authenticators that support FIDO2 authentication is still focused heavily on desktop computers, while for mobile devices, only a limited choice of suitable authenticators is available to users (few roaming authenticators with wireless connectivity and even fewer built-in platform authenticators on mobile devices). This creates a void for users, in particular users of older device generations that lack platform authenticators and the right connectivity, to authenticate themselves with WebAuthn to web-services. In this poster, we present the idea ofsimFIDO, a FIDO2 setup using a recently developed simTPM as (platform) authenticator for mobile devices and even as roaming authenticator offered by mobile devices to connected computers. The move-ability property of the key storage of simTPM makes the users' lives easier for credential portability between devices. In particular, a seamless integration of simTPM with non-mobile devices through phones will help to create a kind of universal authentication setup using FIDO2. Although we present the concrete design and implementation of a SIM card-based FIDO2 authenticator, we hope this poster will contribute to the discussion about how and in which form hardware authenticators can be made available to users.},

While several such protocols have been suggested, the underlying theory has been lagging. We begin by defining a model for this problem, one rich enough to deal with password guessing, forward secrecy, server compromise, and loss of session keys. The one model can be used to define various goals. We take AKE (with ``implicit'' authentication) as the ``basic'' goal, and we give definitions for it, and for entity-authentication goals as well. Then we prove correctness for the idea at the center of the Encrypted Key-Exchange (EKE) protocol of Bellovin and Merritt: we prove security, in an ideal-cipher model, of the two-flow protocol at the core of EKE.",

abstract = {In this paper we extend the notion of zero knowledge proofs of membership (which reveal one bit of information) to zero knowledge proofs of knowledge (which reveal no information whatsoever). After formally defining this notion, we show its relevance to identification schemes, in which parties prove their identity by demonstrating their knowledge rather than by proving the validity of assertions. We describe a novel scheme which is provably secure if factoring is difficult and whose practical implementations are about two orders of magnitude faster than RSA-based identification schemes. In the last part of the paper we consider the question of sequential versus parallel executions of zero knowledge protocols, define a new notion of “transferable information”, and prove that the parallel version of our identification scheme (which is not known to be zero knowledge) is secure since it reveals no transferable information.},

Security requires, in particular, that the protocol cannot be broken by an off-line dictionary attack in which an adversary enumerates all possible passwords in an attempt to determine the correct one based on previously-viewed transcripts.

abstract="Password-Authenticated Key Exchange (PAKE) protocols allow two parties that only share a password to establish a shared key in a way that is immune to offline attacks. Asymmetric PAKE (aPAKE) strengthens this notion for the more common client-server setting where the server stores a mapping of the password and security is required even upon server compromise, that is, the only allowed attack in this case is an (inevitable) offline exhaustive dictionary attack against individual user passwords. Unfortunately, most suggested aPAKE protocols (that dispense with the use of servers' public keys) allow for pre-computation attacks that lead to the instantaneous compromise of user passwords upon server compromise, thus forgoing much of the intended aPAKE security. Indeed, these protocols use -- in essential ways -- deterministic password mappings or use random ``salt'' transmitted in the clear from servers to users, and thus are vulnerable to pre-computation attacks.",

It is shown that one intuitive and two technical definitions we consider are asymptotically equivalent, and the indistinguishability-based technical definition is the strongest, i.e., the most secure when achieved, when the exact reduction cost is taken into account. We then extend our result to the threshold case where a subset of members cooperate to create a signature. The threshold setting makes the notion of anonymity more complex and yields a greater variety of definitions. We explore several notions and observe certain relation does not seem hold unlike the simple single-signer case. Nevertheless, we see that an indistinguishability-based definition is the most favorable in the threshold case. We also present a notion of anonymity with linkability and a simple generic construction.",

abstract="In most password-authenticated key exchange systems there is a single server storing password verification data. To provide some resilience against server compromise, this data typically takes the form of a one-way function of the password (and possibly a salt, or other public values), rather than the password itself. However, if the server is compromised, this password verification data can be used to perform an offline dictionary attack on the user's password. In this paper we propose an efficient password-authenticated key exchange system involving a set of servers, in which a certain threshold of servers must participate in the authentication of a user, and in which the compromise of any fewer than that threshold of servers does not allow an attacker to perform an offline dictionary attack. We prove our system is secure in the random oracle model under the Decision Diffie-Hellman assumption against an attacker that may eavesdrop on, insert, delete, or modify messages between the user and servers, and that compromises fewer than that threshold of servers.",

abstract = {Distributed key generation is a main component of threshold cryptosystems and distributed cryptographic computing in general. Solutions to the distributed generation of private keys for discrete-log based cryptosystems have been known for several years and used in a variety of protocols and in many research papers. However, these solutions fail to provide the full security required and claimed by these works. We show how an active attacker controlling a small number of parties can bias the values of the generated keys, thus violating basic correctness and secrecy requirements of a key generation protocol. In particular, our attacks point out to the places where the proofs of security fail. Based on these findings we designed a distributed key generation protocol which we present here together with a rigorous proof of security. Our solution, that achieves optimal resiliency, can be used as a drop-in replacement for key generation modules as well as other components of threshold or proactive discrete-log based cryptosystems.},

We prove security of our scheme under the LRSW assumption for groups with bilinear maps. We then show how our scheme can be used to construct efficient anonymous credential systems as well as group signature and identity escrow schemes. To this end, we provide efficient protocols that allow one to prove in zero-knowledge the knowledge of a signature on a committed (or encrypted) message and to obtain a signature on a committed message.",

abstract = {Session cookies constitute one of the main attack targets against client authentication on the Web. To counter these attacks, modern web browsers implement native cookie protection mechanisms based on the HttpOnly and Secure flags. While there is a general understanding about the effectiveness of these defenses, no formal result has so far been proved about the security guarantees they convey. With the present paper we provide the first such result, by presenting a mechanized proof of noninterference assessing the robustness of the HttpOnly and Secure cookie flags against both web and network attackers with the ability to perform arbitrary XSS code injection. We then develop CookiExt, a browser extension that provides client-side protection against session hijacking, based on appropriate flagging of session cookies and automatic redirection over HTTPS for HTTP requests carrying these cookies. Our solution improves over existing client-side defenses by combining protection against both web and network attacks, while at the same time being designed so as to minimise its effects on the user’s browsing experience. Finally, we report on the experiments we carried out to practically evaluate the effectiveness of our approach.},

abstract = {Typical web sessions can be hijacked easily by a network eavesdropper in attacks that have come to be designated "sidejacking." The rise of ubiquitous wireless networks, often unprotected at the transport layer, has significantly aggravated this problem. While SSL can protect against eavesdropping, its usability disadvantages often make it unsuitable when the data is not considered highly confidential. Most web-based email services, for example, use SSL only on their login page and are thus vulnerable to sidejacking.We propose SessionLock, a simple approach to securing web sessions against eavesdropping without extending the use of SSL. SessionLock is easily implemented by web developers using only JavaScript and simple server-side logic. Its performance impact is negligible, and all major web browsers are supported. Interestingly, it is particularly easy to implement on single-page AJAX web applications, e.g. Gmail or Yahoo mail, with approximately 200 lines of JavaScript and 60 lines of server-side verification code.},

abstract="Pseudorandom function tribe ensembles are pseudorandom function ensembles that have an additional collision resistance property: almost all functions have disjoint ranges. We present an alternative to the construction of pseudorandom function tribe ensembles based on one-way permutations given by Canetti, Micciancio and Reingold [7]. Our approach yields two different but related solutions: One construction is somewhat theoretic, but conceptually simple and therefore gives an easier proof that one-way permutations suffice to construct pseudorandom function tribe ensembles. The other, slightly more complicated solution provides a practical construction; it starts with an arbitrary pseudorandom function ensemble and assimilates the one-way permutation to this ensemble. Therefore, the second solution inherits important characteristics of the underlying pseudorandom function ensemble: it is almost as efficient and if the starting pseudorandom function ensemble is invertible then so is the derived tribe ensemble. We also show that the latter solution yields so-called committing private-key encryption schemes. i.e., where each ciphertext corresponds to exactly one plaintext --- independently of the choice of the secret key or the random bits used in the encryption process.",

abstract = {Single sign-on (SSO) systems, such as OpenID and OAuth, allow web sites, so-called relying parties (RPs), to delegate user authentication to identity providers (IdPs), such as Facebook or Google. These systems are very popular, as they provide a convenient means for users to log in at RPs and move much of the burden of user authentication from RPs to IdPs. There is, however, a downside to current systems, as they do not respect users' privacy: IdPs learn at which RP a user logs in. With one exception, namely Mozilla's BrowserID system (a.k.a. Mozilla Persona), current SSO systems were not even designed with user privacy in mind. Unfortunately, recently discovered attacks, which exploit design flaws of BrowserID, show that BrowserID does not provide user privacy either.In this paper, we therefore propose the first privacy-respecting SSO system for the web, called SPRESSO (for Secure Privacy-REspecting Single Sign-On). The system is easy to use, decentralized, and platform independent. It is based solely on standard HTML5 and web features and uses no browser extensions, plug-ins, or other executables.Existing SSO systems and the numerous attacks on such systems illustrate that the design of secure SSO systems is highly non-trivial. We therefore also carry out a formal analysis of SPRESSO based on an expressive model of the web in order to formally prove that SPRESSO enjoys strong authentication and privacy properties.},

abstract = {OpenID Connect is the most widely used Internet protocol for delegated authentication today. It provides single sign-on functionality for users who use their account with an identity provider to authenticate to different services, called relying parties. Unfortunately OpenID Connect is not privacy-friendly: the identity provider learns with each use which relying party the user logs in to. This necessitates a high degree of trust in the identity provider, and is especially problematic when the relying parties' identity reveals sensitive information. We present two extensions to OpenID Connect that address this privacy concern. We first present a simple extension that prevents the identity provider from learning to which relying parties its users log in, and we further extend this solution to also prevent colluding relying parties from tracking users. We give formal security proofs for both standard OpenID Connect and our extensions using the Tamarin security protocol verification tool.},

In this paper, we present the initial design of an alternative SSO solution called VC-SSO to address the security and privacy problems while preserving SSO's usability. VC-SSO leverages the recently emerged decentralized identifier (DID) and verifiable credential (VC) framework in that a user only needs to authenticate with the IdP once to obtain a VC and then may generate multiple verifiable presentations (VPs) from the VC to access different RPs. This is based on the design that each RP has established a smart contract with the IdP specifying the service agreement and the VP schema for user authorization. We hope the proposed VC-SSO design marks the first step toward a future SSO system that provides strong reliability and privacy to users under adversarial conditions.},
